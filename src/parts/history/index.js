            6th Man Creative was born as a dream to provide Central American
            talent the opportunity to work with clients in the U.S. market. Our
            founder, an immigrant from the small country of El Salvador, wanted
            to find a way to give back to his community. So he took it upon
            himself to go to Central America and find highly talented folks in
            the creative field.
            <div className="special-text">
              He was delighted when he discovered amazing, talented, motivated
              people doing incredible work at the highest levels on all creative
              fields.

            Impressed by the quality of the work, our founder decided to put
            together a team of highly skilled professionals to fulfill any
            marketing creative need. And so, 6th Man Creative was born.
            Operating out of Redondo Beach, CA in the US, 6th Man Creative
            continues its efforts to bring forth Latin American talent in the
            creative field.
